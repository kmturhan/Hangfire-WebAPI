# Hangfire
In web applications need tasks to work continuously at certain times but web applications work on requests. So we can't start a task without triggering. We can do it with Hangfire.

# Hangfire-WebAPI
I developed a simple web application to try Hangfire.

# Installation
* Hangfire needs a database.
* You need to change the **ConnectionString** field in the **appsettings.json** file for the database connection.
